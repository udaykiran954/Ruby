# Ruby on Rails Internship – Day-wise Learning Notes

# Day1
First Day at DaySpring Technologies as intern -> completed all installations (Ruby, Rails) and compiled my first program.

## Ruby
- Everything in ruby is object (method also acts a object)
- Follow SOLID principals where I is silent
- very simple and readable

## Rails
- rails is framework of ruby we used to build dynamic application
- Rails is a MVC architecture

### Commands
- to check ruby version -> ruby -v
- For rails installation -> gem install rails
- to create rails application -> rails new ApplicationName
- to run the server -> rails s
- to change port number -> rails s -p portnumber

---

# Day2
Second Day at Dayspring Technologies as intern

- to create a rails application with database -> rails new applicatoname -d databasetype
- skip command, js command uses as extension in rails new command
- we can add through rails new command

### Rails Console
- rails console
- rails c

### Database Commands
- rails db:create
- rails db:seed (to see)
- rails db:migrate (used in production we get exception if we can't use this command)

### Scaffold
rails generate scaffold Customer name:string email:string

---

# Day3

- Syntactic sugar
- Convention over configuration

### Rails Flow
end point  
|  
controller methods actions  
|  
model  
|  
view  

- routes.rb -> we will define end points used for navigation if delete application won't run
- bin -> not modifiable autogenerated if we delete application won't run

config -> all the things required for a application  
|       |       |  
|   environment -> replicate and to test this files are extendable modifiable customizable  
|               |  
initializers    |  
                |  
                locales -> extendable  

Other files:
- rake
- boot.rb
- application.rb

---

# Day4

- secrets.rb -> we put secured data
- creditinal.yml used for different environment
- database.yml designed for sql databases
- deploy.yml instructions we can give for deployment
- environment.rb if we delete this application will not run
- importmap.rb released after rails 7
- puma.rb default server

### Routing
- member route
- collection route
- nested route

---

# Day5 (Ruby)

## Variables
There are 5 types of Variables

1. global Variables  
   $college_name = "IIIT"

2. class Variables  
   @@count = 0

3. instance Variables  
   @name = "uday"

4. local Variables  
   a = 10

5. constant Variables  
   PI = 3.14

## Datatypes
ruby is dynamically typed language we don't need to mention datatypes

Examples:
a = 10  
b = 19.10  
c = "uday"  
d = :uday  
flag = true  

Datatypes:
- Integer
- String
- Symbol
- boolean / nil

## String
- String is mutable in ruby  
  name = "uday"

## Symbol
- Symbol is immmutable  
  name = :uday

## Note
We can check which datatype of a variable using class method

a = 10  
a.class -> Integer  

a = :uday  
a.class -> symbol  

b = "uday"  
b.class -> string  

## Input from User
In ruby we can take the input from the user by the gets.chomp method

a = gets.chomp  
puts a  

## TypeConversion
a = "10"  
b = a.to_i  

- to_i -> Integer
- to_s -> String
- to_f -> Float

# Day6 (Ruby)

## Loops

### for
for i in 1..10  
  puts i  
end  

### while
i = 1  
while i <= 5  
  puts "hi"  
  i += 1  
end  

### loop
m = 1  
loop do  
  puts "hello"  
  break if m == 5  
  m += 1  
end  

### until
j = 0  
until j > 5  
  puts j  
  j = j + 1  
end  

### break
i = 7  
loop do  
  puts "hello"  
  break if i == 10  
  i += 1  
end  

### next
for k in 1..5  
  next if k % 2 == 0  
  puts k  
end  

### redo
flag = true  
for x in 2..4  
  puts x  
  if x == 2 && flag == true  
    flag = false  
    redo  
  end  
end  

## Array Methods

### select
arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]  
arr2 = arr.select { |i| i % 2 == 0 }  

### each
arr2.each do |i|  
  puts i  
end  

### reject
arr.reject { |i| i % 2 == 0 }  

Note: select! modifies original array

### all?
arr.all? { |n| n >= 5 }  

### any?
arr.any? { |n| n >= 5 }  

### map
num = [1,2,3,4,5,6]  
num2 = num.map { |m| m * 2 }  

### each
num.each { |i| i * 2 }  

### collect
num3 = num.collect { |i| i * 3 }

# Day7 (Ruby)

## Inheritance
- only single level Inheritance is possible in ruby
- we can represent Inheritance by using < symbol

class Base  
end  

class Child < Base  
end  

## super
super keyword look up to the ancestors for a method until a method found

## Object Hierachy
Child  
|  
Base  
|  
Object  
|  
Kernel  
|  
BasicObject  

### Example
class Base  
  def welcome  
    "welcoming you from base class"  
  end  
end  

class Child < Base  
  def welcome  
    super  
    "welocming you from child class"  
  end  
end  

obj = Child.new  
puts obj.welcome  

### ancestors
Child.ancestors  

### respond_to?
obj.respond_to?(:methodname)  

---

# Day8 (Ruby)

## Conditional Statment

### if / else
stock = 20  
is_available = false  

if stock > 0  
  is_available = true  
else  
  puts "Item not available"  
end  

puts is_available  

### Ternary
is_active = true  
a = (is_active) ? "present" : "not present"  
puts a  

### elsif
price = 500  
discount = 0  

if price >= 100 && price < 200  
  discount = 10  
elsif price >= 200 && price < 300  
  discount = 20  
elsif price >= 300 && price < 400  
  discount = 30  
elsif price >= 400 && price < 500  
  discount = 40  
elsif price >= 500 && price < 600  
  discount = 50  
else  
  discount = 5  
end  

puts discount  

### case
case  
when 100..200  
  discount = 10  
when 201..300  
  discount = 20  
when 301..400  
  discount = 30  
when 401..500  
  discount = 40  
when 500..600  
  discount = 50  
else  
  discount = 5  
end  

puts discount  

### unless
email = true  

unless email  
  puts "email unavailable"  
else  
  puts "email available"  
end  

## Methods
- public
- private
- protected

# Day9 (Rails)

## Rails Validations

Validations can be done in 2 ways  
1. through UI  
2. through Model  

Through UI triggered at the time of entering the fields  
Through Model triggered at the time of submitting  

### Model Validations
validates :name, format: { with: /\A[a-zA-Z]+\z/, message: "Only letters are allowed" }  
validates :stock, numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 10 }  
validates :price, numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 100 }  
validates :description, length: { maximum: 500 }  

### Custom Validation
validate :check_price  

def check_price  
  if stock == 0 && price > 0  
    errors.add "this is not allowed"  
  end  
end  

## Scope
- used for repeated query
- method chaining
